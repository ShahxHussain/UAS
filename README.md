<h1>University Admission System</h1>

<p>Welcome to the University Admission System repository! This Java-based project aims to automate the entire admission process for universities, reducing the workload and improving efficiency. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles, including object-oriented analysis and object-oriented design, to provide a robust and scalable solution. The system uses the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) database for data storage and retrieval.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The University Admission System is designed to streamline the admission process from notification to enrollment. By leveraging online admissions, it eliminates geographical barriers and reduces the time and effort required from both students and university staff. The system offers centralized data management, paperless admissions, and integration with other institutions for verification purposes.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Online admission process: Students can apply for admission through an intuitive web interface, eliminating the need for physical forms and paperwork.</li>
  <li>Notification system: Keep students informed about important dates, deadlines, and updates related to the admission process.</li>
  <li>Centralized data handling: Store and manage student information, academic records, and other relevant data in a secure and organized manner using the SSMS database.</li>
  <li>Integration with external institutions: Facilitate the verification of marks and details by integrating with other educational institutions.</li>
  <li>Operational efficiency: Automate various tasks, reducing manual effort and improving overall efficiency.</li>
  <li>User-friendly interface: Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both students and university staff to interact with the system.</li>
</ul>
